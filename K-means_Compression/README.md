Here you are asked to choose the number of colors you want your input image to be compressed to; then the clustering algorithm appears. However, there are many other ways to compress images much more efficiently. Here are some examples:

![Example1](River_2)
![Example1](River_36)
![Example1](Portrait_2)
![Example1](Portrait_16)
![Example1](Colorful_21)
